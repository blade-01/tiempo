Yayy ðŸ¤¾!!! I built a weather app for checking users weather based on location input.


### Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

### Useful Resources

- [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - This is the API used for fetching weather data.
- [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/) - This was used for date and time formatting.


## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/UgCqszKR7Q7oqb4kRfI0) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the web app depending on their device's screen size
- See a default location.
- Search for city.
- See weather updates by 3hrs.
- See the date and location of the weather.
- See an image according to each type of weather.
- See temperature in both Celsius and Farenheit.
- See humidiy, wind direction, visibility and pressure values.

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
